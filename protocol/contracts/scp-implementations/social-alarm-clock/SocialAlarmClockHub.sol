/*

In development: The Social Alarm Clock Hub is derived from 'CommitmenetHub.sol' and
provides the functionality to create Alarms and provide sufficient indexing and logging
for the front-end to display the state of any user's Alarms.

Currently, the frontend is using the CommitmentHub to deploy Alarms, but I need more
specialized functionality for the Social Alarm Clock, so I will be creating a new Hub here.
